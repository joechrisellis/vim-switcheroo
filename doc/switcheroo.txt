INTRODUCTION                                    *switcheroo-introduction*

This plugin allows you to extend the functionality of the |~| key in Vim.

In vanilla Vim, the |~| key is used to switch the case of either the character
under the cursor or the visually selected text. Similarly, |g~| is an operator
to switch the case of characters over a text object or motion.

Using this plugin, you can define new pairs of alternative characters. For
example, you can make `-` be switched to `_` and `_` be switched to `-` with
the |~| key.


INSTALLATION                                    *switcheroo-installation*

The easiest way to install the plugin is with a plugin manager.

- vim-plug: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug
- Vundle:   https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim

If you use one, just follow the instructions in its documentation For
example, if you use vim-plug, you would want to add the following line to your
Vim configuration:
>
    Plug 'joechrisellis/vim-switcheroo'

MAPS                                            *switcheroo-maps*
                                                *switcheroo-shadows*
To implement the custom switching behaviour, the plugin shadows the following
built-in maps:

    |~|, |g~|, |g~~|, |g~g~|


CONFIGURATION                                   *switcheroo-configuration*
                                                *g:switcheroo*

There is a single configuration variable, |g:switcheroo|, which you use to
create pairs of alternate characters. An example is below:
>
    let g:switcheroo = [
    \ ["'", '"'],
    \ ["-", "_"],
    \ ]
<
This will cause the |~| key to switch `'` to `"` (and vice-versa), and `-` to
`_` (and vice-versa).

Make sure that your configuration is loaded after the plugin. This usually
means putting it inside an |after-directory|.
