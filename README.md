# vim-switcheroo

Vim plugin that lets you extend the behaviour of the `~` key.

In vanilla Vim, the `~` key is used to switch the case of either the character
under the cursor or the visually selected text. Similarly, `g~` is an operator
to switch the case of characters over a text object or motion.

Using this plugin, you can define new pairs of alternative characters. For
example, you can make `-` be switched to `_` and `_` be switched to `-` with
the `~` key.

Check out the [documentation](doc/switcheroo.txt) for more.
